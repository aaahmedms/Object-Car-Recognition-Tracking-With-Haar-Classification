# Object-Car-Recognition-Tracking-With-Haar-Classification

Tracking Cars using Haar classification with OpenCV using a trained cascade classifier.

![Output sample](https://github.com/sahmed01a/Object-Car-Recognition-Tracking-With-Haar-Classification/blob/master/screenshots/footage.gif)

There are two examples included here, one with regular tracking using a generic square, the other is an edged square:
